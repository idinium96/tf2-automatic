Before you install the bot, there are a few things you need to have taken care off before you will be able to run the bot.

- You need a separate Steam account with a mobile authenticator. I suggest using the [Steam Desktop Authenticator](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator) to authenticate the account and get the secret keys used to automate generating 2FA codes and managing mobile confirmations.
- NodeJS version 8 or more
- Typescript 3.7 or above

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Nicklason/tf2-automatic/wiki) for setting up the bot. For additional help and questions, please ask in the IdiNium's Trading Bot [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZrVT7mc) or create an [issue](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2-automatic/issues/new/choose).

## Download and installation

You can clone or download the bot by clicking on the green button in the top right, follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/Nicklason/tf2-automatic/wiki/Installation) for more instructions.

## Configuration

Once you have downloaded the source and installed the necessary packages, you can move on to configuring the bot. Follow the [configuration guide](https://github.com/Nicklason/tf2-automatic/wiki/Configuration).


## Additional Configuration for Discord Webhook feature

If you want to use this feature, you must use [ecosystem.template.json](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2-automatic/blob/Public/ecosystem.template.json) from this version, which contains much more variables for you to fill in.

## Variables in ecosystem.json summary

### Your bot credentials
- STEAM_ACCOUNT_NAME: username that is used to login (preferably your bot/alt Steam account).
- STEAM_PASSWORD: your bot Steam account password.
- STEAM_SHARED_SECRET: you can found this in `<Your Bot SteamID64>.maFile` inside ~/SDA/maFiles (named `shared_secret`).
- STEAM_IDENTITY_SECRET: same as above (named `identity_secret`).

### Prices.TF token
- PRICESTF_API_TOKEN: You can leave this empty. No need at all.

### Backpack.tf token and API Key
You can run your bot without this first, which then on the first run, it will print out your bot backpack.tf access token and apiKey. You'll need to copy and paste it into your ecosystem.json or .env file, [see this image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/697415702637838366/697820077248086126/bptf-api-token.png), BUT if you want to find it yourself, then,
